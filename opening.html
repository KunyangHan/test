            <div class="contents">
                <p>
                    Thanks for your interest in joining my group! We always have openings for outstanding students. 
                    Interested candidates for Master/PhD opportunities  are strongly encouraged to contact Prof. Wei by 
                    <a href="mailto:yunchao.wei@bjtu.edu.cn">email</a>. Please attach your CV, and clearly discuss your research interests, 
                    coding skills and English ability. Besides, we are alway open to working with outstanding <b>BJTU undergraduates</b>  
                    for some research projects, and you are welcome to my office to have a discussion. We provide extraordinarily strong 
                    support to students for internship, visiting, collaboration, and networking opportunities. You can talk with current 
                    group members for more details. 
                </p>

                <strong>Basic Information</strong>

                <ul>
                    <li>We always have openings for truly outstanding PhD students, starting at every year's spring and
                        fall
                        semesters (so no need to inquiry "whether you have PhD openings" by email). Our group is well
                        funded, and research assistantships will be provided to PhD students by default.
                    </li>
                    <li>Interested candidates for PhD opportunities are strongly encouraged to contact Dr. Wang by <a
                            href="mailto:atlaswang@utexas.edu">email</a>. Please attach your CV, and clearly discuss
                        your
                        research interest and experiences. We are usually not very interested in your GPA and standard
                        test
                        scores.
                    </li>
                    <li>Postdocs, and self-funded visitors are welcome to apply, and will be evaluated case by case. Due
                        to
                        the recent challenging situation of international travels, we are also open to remote
                        collaborations, on certain basic research topics of common interest.
                    </li>
                    <li>We are always open to working with UT undergraduates and master students for research projects.
                        Please contact Dr. Wang by <a href="mailto:atlaswang@utexas.edu">email</a> and specify your
                        interest.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <strong>What we expect from good candidates?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nothing is more important than a true enthusiasm and devotion to research. We do research only
                        because we are really obsessed with and enjoy our research. Our research interests constantly
                        evolve, and we always stay open to be intellectually excited and inspired by new things.
                    </li>
                    <li>Two other important things that we look for: (1) a truly deep understanding of your problem of
                        interest - don’t naively plug and play "hot" tools; (2) a solid background and a true passion
                        for
                        mathematics. Our research heavily leverages matrix analysis, optimization, and statistical
                        learning.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <strong>What we provide to our students?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>We have a very flat management structure with minimal communication overhead (“Talk is cheap.
                        Show
                        me the code/math”). Every student works directly and closely with Dr. Wang. The group also
                        benefits
                        a lot from its highly interactive, intimate, and helpful culture.
                    </li>
                    <li>We provide extraordinarily strong support to students for internship, visiting, collaboration,
                        and
                        networking opportunities. You can check from current group members' rich experiences.
                    </li>
                    <li>Our students are highly sought after by top employers, for both internship and full-time
                        opportunities. Taking summer 2021 for one example, VITA students secure research internship
                        offers
                        from Google Brain (2), Facebook Research (2), Microsoft Research (2), Amazon (2), Adobe
                        Research,
                        ByteDance, etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>
