            <h4 class="title">For Prospective Students</h4>

            <strong>Basic Information</strong>

            <ul>
                <li>We always have openings for truly outstanding PhD students, starting at every year's spring and fall
                    semesters (so no need to inquiry "whether you have PhD openings" by email). Our group is well
                    funded, and research assistantships will be provided to PhD students by default.
                </li>
                <li>Interested candidates for PhD opportunities are strongly encouraged to contact Dr. Wang by <a
                        href="mailto:atlaswang@utexas.edu">email</a>. Please attach your CV, and clearly discuss your
                    research interest and experiences. We are usually not very interested in your GPA and standard test
                    scores.
                </li>
                <li>Postdocs, and self-funded visitors are welcome to apply, and will be evaluated case by case. Due to
                    the recent challenging situation of international travels, we are also open to remote
                    collaborations, on certain basic research topics of common interest.
                </li>
                <li>We are always open to working with UT undergraduates and master students for research projects.
                    Please contact Dr. Wang by <a href="mailto:atlaswang@utexas.edu">email</a> and specify your
                    interest.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <strong>What we expect from good candidates?</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Nothing is more important than a true enthusiasm and devotion to research. We do research only
                    because we are really obsessed with and enjoy our research. Our research interests constantly
                    evolve, and we always stay open to be intellectually excited and inspired by new things.
                </li>
                <li>Two other important things that we look for: (1) a truly deep understanding of your problem of
                    interest - don’t naively plug and play "hot" tools; (2) a solid background and a true passion for
                    mathematics. Our research heavily leverages matrix analysis, optimization, and statistical learning.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <strong>What we provide to our students?</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>We have a very flat management structure with minimal communication overhead (“Talk is cheap. Show
                    me the code/math”). Every student works directly and closely with Dr. Wang. The group also benefits
                    a lot from its highly interactive, intimate, and helpful culture.
                </li>
                <li>We provide extraordinarily strong support to students for internship, visiting, collaboration, and
                    networking opportunities. You can check from current group members' rich experiences.
                </li>
                <li>Our students are highly sought after by top employers, for both internship and full-time
                    opportunities. Taking summer 2021 for one example, VITA students secure research internship offers
                    from Google Brain (2), Facebook Research (2), Microsoft Research (2), Amazon (2), Adobe Research,
                    ByteDance, etc.
                </li>
            </ul>
